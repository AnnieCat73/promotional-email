## Overview

A responsive promotional email without media queries

I have tested the email on 70 plus different devices and email clients. The email works fine in the majority of the email clients.

Occasionally I have noticed a faint horizontal line going through the footer section in Outlook or when displayed in dark mode. I have
looked into this and there is no proper fix for this. It has all to do with how Outlook renders your email when you open it. Sometimes
it renders it well but occasionally you may see this faint line.

### The challenge

Creating a fully responsive email without media queries. Most email apps support modern CSS and media queries
but there are still many that don't. With this in mind the challenge is to build a responsive email that works for both email clients that
support and for those that do NOT support modern CSS, like media queries. I am using the fluid hybrid method of HTML email development to achieve this.

## My process

- Based on a promotional email I found in my own email inbox
- I created a fictitious company and I heavily customised the email content
- I added images from https://www.pexels.com/ and https://pixabay.com/. They are optimised and hosted online
- I coded the email follwing CSS2 specificaton, using tables, inline CSS and div/media queries for email clients that support them
- Made it look as good as possible for dark mode
- I used Desktop-first approach as that's the best practice for email development
- I tested my email using Email on Acid
- I uploaded the email to the web via Cloudflare

### Built with

- HTML5 markup with CSS2
- An HTML Tag that defines the XML and OOMXML (Office Open XML) which The HTML document needs for the email to work on Outlook on Windows
- An Apple Scaling Meta Tag that prevents any unwanted scaling or zooming from Apple
- An IE9 Meta Tag used for improving rendering in Iternet Explorer 9 or lower
- An XML Tag that ensures that Microsoft Outlook transforms everything in our email to adapt to the screen zoom percentage in Windows
- Inline CSS which is best practice for email as some clients strip out the head tag in emails
- Some media queries within the style tag in the head tag for clients that do support them. This is for enhancement only
- For apps that support modern CSS I am using an outer container in the form of a div which has the use of max-width and display:inline-block
  properties
- For email clients that do not support modern CSS I use Ghost tables which are restrictive table layouts for Outlook email clients
- Divs, max-width and display:inline-block are used for layouts with 2 and more columns. For a single column layout I use tables
- For 2 columns and more I also have a nested div inside each column for padding. This is applied to the ghost table cells for Outlook
- Use of a spacer div to create space between sections
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to code a responsive email and how to test an email for the various email clients

### Continued development

I will continue to improve and practice coding emails!
